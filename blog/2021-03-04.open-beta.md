Hello everyone!
I am very proud to announce the open beta of Raise and Shine, a height map
visual editor with automatic normal map generation for 2D textures!

It has been exciting 5 weeks of development and I hope I'll be able to
invest many more to make it even more awesome!

Right now, with Raise and Shine, we are able to:
- Create selections using the Rectangle, Ellipse, Line and Freehand tools
- Create complex selections by combining them with left mouse button and removing them with right mouse button
- Use the Height tool to drag the selected area up or down, all with real time visualization in 3D
- Create curved height patterns using the BÃ©zier curve editor and applying them with the Height tool
- Create and edit lights' color, energy and position to preview the illuminated texture in 2D and 3D in real time
- Undo and Redo selections and height changes as well as choosing one of the previous revisions in the History tab
- Load and save the albedo, height and generated normal maps as images
- Save the illuminated texture preview as image
- Edit height maps and generate normal maps on the web browser and on desktop platforms running Windows, Linux or Mac OS

For the next releases, we can expect:
- Height painting tools similar to terrain and other bump map editors
- More selection tools, like Lasso and Polygon tools
- Orbiting light mode for previewing lighting from all angles at a fixed speed
- Better performance on big resolution textures
- Customizable and dockable layout of the open tabs, by dragging them around
- Localization to Portuguese

I'll be posting devlogs regularly with the latest updates on features, technical
problems and solutions, some tutorials and more!
I'm learning a lot from this project and am eager to share this knowledge =D

If you like or use this tool, consider buying the desktop version and spreading
the word to support its development =]
