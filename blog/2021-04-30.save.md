Last update of the month: *Both Highs and Lows are important, keep them as you please!*

This week we bring you with two new brush modes: `Highest` and `Lowest`, great for making
peaks and valleys and for not overwriting another heigher/lower area.

Whether you're in the highs and your work is done or you're in the lows and accidentally
pressed `Alt + F4`, we got you covered! Now you can save your work easily by issuing
`Ctrl + S` or pressing the `File -> Save` menu button, which will save both height and
normal maps in the same folder as the loaded albedo texture, suffixed with `_height` and
`_normal`. Also, if you have unsaved work and try to close the window, a confirmation
dialog will appear.

This only works on the Desktop builds, since web browsers don't lend
applications access to the file system, so I highly recommend you use Raise and
Shine on Desktop!

Now, Raise and Shine is getting every nicer to use, and we are 2 months in development =]

I hope you like it as well, and encourage you to send
[ideas and suggestions](https://itch.io/t/1299103/ideas-and-suggestions-),
[report bugs](https://itch.io/t/1299126/bug-tracker-) you find
and [share your creations](https://itch.io/t/1299149/show-your-creation-)
at the [discussion board](https://gilzoide.itch.io/raise-and-shine/community)!
Also, consider sharing it with the world and buying the Desktop builds to
support the development of this awesome tool!

See you all next week!
